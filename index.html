<p>My name is Kelsey MacMillan and I am a Graphic Designer. Becoming a Graphic Designer was not one of my first choices. I became aware of the designing world in grade 11 during high school. In the beginning I could always see myself doing somthing with sports because I was physically active in sports all through high school and my older sister did it so why not? I soon discovered that I was nothing like my sister in the sense that painting, drawing and designing were my talents as well. with all my sports throughout high school, I joined the art classes and  became a part of the Arnprior District High School yearbook team. My parents have worked Magenet Signs for 15 years and growing up in a graphic design environment it made me realize this is what I wanted to do. I started out by applying to colleges and soon fell in love with Algonquin College, where I was accepted into the Graphic Design program in 2011. Throughout the course of 2 years I have discovered designing is not always easy and there is a lot of compitition, but that's what has kept me going. With the help of my family and meeting two very good friends in the course, it has helped me with encouragement and inspiration to keep designing. As of now I am starting my third year and I am more confident than I ever have been and eagar to learn new things.</p>
